# University SMS Dissemination

The "University SMS Dissemination" project is a streamlined system designed to send exam results directly to students via SMS, ensuring fast and secure delivery of important information. 
By leveraging an SMS gateway, the system automates the process of notifying students about their grades, providing an efficient alternative to traditional methods like email or physical notice boards.
The system consists of a student database, a result management module, and an admin interface, allowing university staff to upload results and manage student information seamlessly. 
Once the results are compiled and verified, personalized SMS messages are generated and sent to each student's registered phone number. This ensures that students can receive their results instantly, even without internet access, making it a highly accessible solution.
Additionally, the system emphasizes data security and privacy, ensuring that only the intended recipients receive their grades. 
Overall, the "University SMS Dissemination" project offers a convenient, efficient, and reliable way for universities to communicate exam results to their students.
